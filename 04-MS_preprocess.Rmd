calcCiS: Calculate correlation inside samples
That means correlation across the peak = is it really coeluting or not?
It is correlation inside the sample; not inside a sample group. This means that camera goes back to the raw data and compares extracted ion chromatograms.
The illutration in Carsten's paper show this: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac202450g
This will fail if compounds are perfectly coeluting.

calcCaS: Calculate correlation accross samples
They are correlated if high intensity of feature A means high intensity of feature B. The study design or sample groups are not used for this information.
Look at these plots. Each dot is a sample.

OpenMS performs peak picking and isotope grouping in one step (any idea how to turn off this?), while XCMS does not perform this step here. 
From Rick: For OpenMS: you can use a trick for this by setting localMZRange=0, this way OpenMS won’t be able to look for isotopes. Note that its detection was more developed for ‘natural compounds’ (eg proteomics, metabolomics) in mind, and that it isn’t really good in grouping halogenated peaks anyway.

## MS-DIAL

MS2Dec: <br> 
Sigma window value: 0.1 - 1.0. Smaller value will avoid clustering of peaks that are far from each other (false positive grouping).  
In GC-HRMS, try 0.8 to separate and deconvolute very closely coeluting peak in GC (+-1). These parameters should be tested with e.g. QC samples with known compounds to get best deconvolution parameter for your samples.
