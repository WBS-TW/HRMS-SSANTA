In some samples containing moisture or water such as soil samples or food samples (animal tissue, fruits, vegetables, and so on) an additional step may be needed either before the extraction step or as a post extraction step to remove the moisture. Sample drying can be accomplished in several ways such as air drying and oven drying prior to extraction. However, these approaches are not suited when analyzing volatile or semi-volatile components as they would be removed from the sample prior to extraction or analysis.
Another common method for moisture removal is by using salts such as sodium sulfate, calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate and the like. These salts tend to associate to water molecules to form hydrated salts. Sodium sulfate for example tends to clump together when water is present.  
Sodium sulfate is not suitable for in-cell moisture removal and accelerated solvent extraction. Sodium sulfate can dissolve in hot solvent to a certain extent and can precipitate downstream in some instances clogging the outlet frit, tubes and valves. Moreover, sodium sulfate becomes an aggregate hard lump upon water absorption and is not easy to process during sample preparation for in-cell moisture removal and extraction.
