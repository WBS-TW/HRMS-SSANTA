Basic knowledge of R programming is a prerequisite to understand some of the codes The author do not take responsibility for programs or computer crashing. Please cite: "],

When this option is activated, input spectra are treated as MS1, and thus, the parent m/z ratio is fully ignored. The molecular networks were created using MetGem 1.2.2 software (https://metgem.github.io/). EI-MS spectra were window filtered by choosing only the top 6 peaks in the ±50 Da window throughout the spectrum. Cosine scores were calculated using a m/z tolerance of 0.3 Th. Networks were then created where edges were filtered to have a cosine score above 0.7 (or 0.75 in the case of GC-EI-MS data from perfumes) and more than six matched peaks. Furthermore, edges between two nodes were kept in the network if and only if each of the nodes appeared in each other’s respective top 10 most similar nodes. The library spectra were filtered in the same manner as the input data. "],

However, a major drawback of the NIST MS Search is that now all chemicals are included and all spectral ions are at unit mass (for EI spectra library, also called mainlib) ## IN SILICO FRAGMENTATION There are three different models that have recently been published to prdict the fragmentation patterns of GC-EI MS. 7.0.1 CFM-ID In silico fragmentation: Help file: https://sourceforge.net/p/cfm-id/wiki/Home/ Use instructions: If you are using EI-MS (GC-MS) data, please use the ei_ms_model provided.
