## LIB2NIST
X. Use LIB2NIST to convert combined msp file to NIST library.  
NEED TO ADD RETENTIONINDEX in comment field (see p31. of https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/srd/NIST1aVer22Man.pdf)  

Convert your library list into NIST library format using LIB2NIST command line (in order to preserve the accurate mass since the GUI tool only convert to nominal mass) __NOTE TO SELF: CHECK IF THIS IS TRUE__. See command line help file for arguments.  
  
IN WINDOWS: open 'cmd', go to the folder where LIB2NIST is and type:
    
COMMAND: __NOTE TO SELF: VERIFY THAT THE COMMAND IS CORRECT, ALSO IS IT POSSIBLE TO ADD RI?__  
`lib2nist.exe /log9 Mylib.log /OutLib /StdRounding:N /MsmsOnly:Y /AccuratePeakMZ /PrecurMzDecPlaces=keep /PeakMzDecPlaces=keep /UseSubset:N <path to msp file> <output path> =<new name of library>`

Mass error (ppm):
  
\begin{equation} 
  ME_{ppm} = \frac{mz_{theor} - mz_{meas}}{mz_{theor}} * 10^6
\end{equation} <br>

where *mz~theor~* is the theoretical exact mass (in u or Da) of the isotope, and *mz~meas~* is the measured accurate mass from the instrument.

  


RMS of isotope mz error ppm:
  
\begin{equation} 
  RMS_{mz} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (ME_{ppm})^2}{n}}
\end{equation} <br>

At least mz of isotopes M+1, M+2 (n >= 2) should be included in the calculations to give good estimate of the average 

RMS of isotope intensities (%):
  
\begin{equation} 
  RMS_{Ab} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (Ab_{theor} - Ab_{meas})^2}{n}}
\end{equation}
