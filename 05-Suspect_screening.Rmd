# **Suspect screening** {#suspect_screening}

<br><br>


## HRMS spectra library setup
1.	Copy the template excel sheet for your analytical run (LC, GC, ESI, EI, POS, NEG,..) to the ”1_Standard_infosheets” folder.  
2.	The ”Spectral_FileName” cell will autogenerate the name for the msp file based on the filled cells. Copy this file name later for the msp file.  
3.	Open MS-DIAL  
4.	Perform peak peaking,….  
a.	Xxx  
b.	Xxx  
c.	Xxx  
d.	Xxx  
5.	Double click on the individual file at the file navigator (click on the text of the file name)  
6.	In the ”peak spot viewer” find the peak of the standard chemical. Click on the triangle to show the deconvoluted spectrum.  
7.	Retention time index is not exported to MS-FINDER. NEED TO FIX or MANUALLY COPY FROM EXCEL INFO SHEET.

<br>

Mass error (ppm): <br>

\begin{equation} 
  ME_{ppm} = \frac{mz_{theor} - mz_{meas}}{mz_{theor}} * 10^6
\end{equation} <br>

where *mz~theor~* is the theoretical exact mass (in u or Da) of the isotope, and *mz~meas~* is the measured accurate mass from the instrument.

<br>


RMS of isotope mz error ppm: <br>
\begin{equation} 
  RMS_{mz} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (ME_{ppm})^2}{n}}
\end{equation} <br>

At least mz of isotopes M, M+1, M+2 (n > 3) should be included in the calculations to give good estimate of the average 

RMS of isotope intensities (%): <br>
\begin{equation} 
  RMS_{Ab} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (Ab_{theor} - Ab_{meas})^2}{n}}
\end{equation} <br>
