# Preface {-}

This is a work-in-progress book to introduce the concepts of suspect and nontarget analysis (SSA/NTA) with focus on environmental analytical chemistry and to provide practical demonstrations for a workflow for SSA/NTA.

- Does not include all the vast number of platforms, software and applications that can be used for SSA/NTA. <br>

- Includes the use of applications that has been developed by the author.

* Basic knowledge of R programming is a prerequisite to understand some of the codes
* The author do not take responsibility for programs or computer crashing.
